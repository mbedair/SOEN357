        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>This project aims to design a <strong>Travel Companion Super App</strong> that facilitates traveling by providing essential services like booking hotels, renting cars, finding activities, and much more. This application aims to bridge the gap between booking your travel plans, and any issues you might face due to local laws and regulations. It is also particularly important to know local information which one might not know as a foreign traveller.</p>
        <p>ReadyToGo! is a visualization of streamlining all a traveller requires in order to head out the door and start their new adventure. Throughout this page we will be taking you into a deep dive into the process of developing the the front end for our project following the steps learned in class to create an inclusive platform. Developed for <strong>SOEN 357 - UX/UI Design Course</strong>, this case study showcases the UX/UI design process, research findings, and final visual prototypes.</p>

    <section id="user-problem">
        <h2>User Problem</h2>
        <p>Travelling in this day and age has become a daunting and strenuous exercise between making your travel itinerary, to booking flights, and worst of all checking all the recent travel regulations. Adding to all of that, in times of natural disasters or extenuating circumstances the regulations become even more complex to follow for each country locally.</p>
        <p>ReadyToGo! Aims to solve this problem for users and get them prepared so that they are “ready to go” on their next adventure. Our super app combines all the necessary features and functions needed to get our users ready for their adventures around the world. The application should enable a user to book appropriate accomodation, flight, check attractions, and travel requirements under one convenient umbrella.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="research-analysis">
        <h2>Research & Analysis</h2>
        <p>Within the research section, we will showcase the how we implemented the different strategies taught in class to gather information to help make our user experience as engaging as possible. We will go through a survey made to guide our efforts first, then talk about competitor analysis, and finally show some personas and user flows.</p>
       
        <h3>Audience Survey Analysis</h3>
        <p>For research purposes, we have sent a survey to be completed by a general audience to get some feedback on key information we might need to develop our product. This survey’s responses have been used to guide some of the information in this project. To start with, which competitors are worth looking into based on their popularity. In addition, deciding which features are used the most and requested. </p>
        <p>The results of the survey showed that a majority of the respondents use Booking, Skyscanner, ArriveCan, and Tripadvisor. This shows that people are usually using these applications in combination to make travel arrangements. This is simply because each one serves a certain purpose so combining all four in terms of main function would be very convenient for the audience. </p>
        <p>Also, an overwhelming majority of the respondents use their laptop to make travel plans, not their mobile devices. This shows us that our platform needs to focus more on making the web version user friendly. The mobile version is less important since 87.5% of the audience replied they use their laptop to make travel plans.</p>
        <p>When asked about what improvements they would like to see in existing applications, the users replied mainly with removal of ads and removal of clutter. A majority of respondents are tired of seeing advertisements on websites generally. This suggests that our approach to revenue should take a different path rather than advertising. Also, making the platform as simple as possible with the least amount of crowding per webpage.</p>

        <h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
        <p>Within the digital space, there are  a few key players that have pioneered the platform of travelling online. We decided to focus on a few key businesses that most people responded they use regularly when making travel plans. Those are booking.com, skyscanner, tripadvisor, and ArriveCan. We will be viewing the pros and cons of each competitor.</p>
        <p>Booking.com is a relatively popular and pioneer in the hotel reservation industry. They were one of the first websites to introduce hotel booking over the internet and they have been successful in boosting engagement with their website. Booking.com plays to two main strengths that we have identified and want to adopt. First is simplicity where users can simply provide the necessary information, and instantly get the results matching their criteria. Second is completeness in a sense that it includes a very large number and variety of hotels and accommodations with great range in pricing. However, booking has two disadvantages that we plan to fix which are failure to include a comparator tool and having there webpage being too cluttered with information.</p>
        <p>Skyscanner is the booking.com of flight bookings online. It is a great tool to find the cheapest flight to a specific destination. Pros of Skyscanner is the ability to view all the different options available to get to the destination, and similar to booking it is extremely easy to operate. The only identified issue is that similar to booking it does not have a comparator tool. Also, similar to booking there is no personalization features in the application that could be used.</p>
        <p>Tripadvisor has been at the cornerstone of any travelers’ itinerary building for years. Tripadvisor leverages user interactions and reviews similar to yelp, in addition to descriptions of destinations and attractions. The website provides a comprehensive view of different attractions available in a specific city, and what you might need to have in order to go to the destination. It includes information like ticket prices and links to purchase tickets as well to help users build their plan accordingly. Its’ main weak point though is that it sometimes can become too detailed to the point of exhaustion for the reader. It can sometimes become difficult to spot the important information from the unnecessary.</p>
        <p>The year 2020 was a monumental shift in how everyone perceives travel. It changed many of the way travel is organized in order to cope with COVID-19. Some of the effects we can still see today. The most prominent is the use of ArriveCan for all Canadians travelling to Canada. ArriveCan started as an application to review and receive pertinent information about travelers coming into Canada during covid about their vaccination information. It has now become an application for making declarations ahead of time as well as a hub for any travel information needed to travel to Canada. Some countries have their version of ArriveCan, but we haven’t been able to identify a single app that presents this information to the user for all countries.</p>

        
        <h3>User Personas</h3>
        <p>In order to guide our project development, we have created three user personas which indicate three different target groups we hope our app will be able to satisfy their needs. Below we will talk more about them and show how they are unique.</p>

        <h3>User Flows</h3>
        <p>User journeys were mapped to ensure a smooth experience when accessing different services like booking flights, renting cars, or receiving safety alerts.</p>
        
        <h3>App Requirements</h3>
        <p>Based on the research and analysis discussed above we have determined five main principles that must be at the center of our design. These requirements will guide our design process to support all the information gathered in order to have a clean user oriented application. These requirements can be shown in the figure below.</p>
