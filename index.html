        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>This project aims to design a <strong>Travel Companion Super App</strong> that supports travelers by providing essential services, such as booking hotels, renting cars, finding activities, and much more. The app is particularly designed to assist users traveling during conflict or disaster by providing critical information like restricted areas, health hazards, and local laws.</p>
        <p>Developed for <strong>SOEN 357 - UX/UI Design Course</strong> as a mini-project for Fall 2024, this case study showcases the UX/UI design process, research findings, and final visual prototypes.</p>

    <section id="user-problem">
        <h2>User Problem</h2>
        <p>When traveling during global conflicts or natural disasters, travelers often face challenges such as understanding local restrictions, visa requirements, and health hazards. This app not only fulfills standard travel needs, like booking tickets and accommodations, but also provides critical updates about safety zones, curfews, and other essential travel information.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="research-analysis">
        <h2>Research & Analysis</h2>
        <h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
        <p>I analyzed various travel apps and super apps to understand their strengths and limitations. This helped to identify opportunities for improvement.</p>

        <h3>User Personas</h3>
        <p>I created several user personas to reflect the needs of diverse travelers in different situations. These personas helped guide design decisions.</p>

        <h3>User Flows</h3>
        <p>User journeys were mapped out to ensure a smooth experience when accessing different services, such as booking flights, renting cars, or receiving safety alerts.</p>

    <section id="design-process">
        <h2>Design Process</h2>
        <h3>Sketches and Wireframes</h3>
        <p>Initial sketches and low-fidelity wireframes were created to explore different layout options and navigation structures.</p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="path-to-your-figma-sketches" alt="Sketches and Wireframes" style="max-width:100%; height:auto;">
        </div>

        <h3>Mockups</h3>
        <p>High-fidelity mockups created in <strong>Figma</strong> showcase the final look and feel of the app, demonstrating interface design, color choices, typography, and interactions.</p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="path-to-your-figma-mockups" alt="High-fidelity mockups" style="max-width:100%; height:auto;">
        </div>

        <h3>Style Guide</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Color Palette:</strong> A calming and neutral color scheme reduces user anxiety in high-stress situations.</li>
            <li><strong>Typography:</strong> Readable fonts with attention to accessibility standards.</li>
            <li><strong>Icons & UI Elements:</strong> Intuitive icons for easy navigation.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="prototypes">
        <h2>Prototypes</h2>
        <p>Interactive prototypes were created to simulate user interactions and validate the app's functionality. Check them out below:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.figma.com/file/your-mobile-version" target="_blank">Mobile Version</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.figma.com/file/your-desktop-version" target="_blank">Desktop Version</a></li>
        </ul>

    <section id="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>This project highlights the importance of creating an app that is not only functional but also mindful of the unique challenges travelers face during difficult times. The design process has been driven by user needs and thorough research, ensuring a practical and easy-to-use app.</p>
